The AX3000 HighPower Wi-Fi AP/Repeater is mainly used for providing free Wi-Fi service in big area such as factory, community, street or etc. The AP/Repeater can take an existing 2.4GHz or 5GHz wireless signal, repeat and extend it to a longer range where it is too far away for the router or access point to reach. 

The AP/Repeater simultaneously supports 2.4G and 5G wireless network connection, and it can supports 2.4G and 5G transmission speeds of up to 3000Mbps. It has 4x External Antennas providing even better wireless performance, transmission rates, stability technology automatically avoids channel conflicts using its channel selection feature.
