## __Energy saving and environmental protection__
<p class="text">
Managing offline devices can help users promptly discover devices that have been in standby mode for a long time and shut down these devices in a timely manner, thereby saving energy, reducing energy consumption, and being more environmentally friendly.

## __Network resource optimization__
