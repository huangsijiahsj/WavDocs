>- Internet VLAN ID : Some ISPs require users to set a VLAN ID on the router before they can access the Internet. If you find that dialing fails or obtaining an IP from the ISP fails, please check whether you need to set a VLAN ID.
>- Auto Mesh : If this function is turned on, the device will automatically switch to Mesh Router or Mesh node mode depending on your network topology. If it is turned off, the device will remain fixed in Mesh Router mode.
