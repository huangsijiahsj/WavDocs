
Here is the first-time wizard for Indoor Repeater. You can refer to this wizard to complete the initial settings of your Indoor Repeater.

Every product requires initialization settings before use. Before initialization settings, we need to __power on the device__. After powering on, you need to connect the device. The different connection methods are listed below. You can choose any one of them and follow the steps to complete the connection.
