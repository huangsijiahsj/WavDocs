<p class="text">
Port forwarding is a network technology that maps a specific port on the public network to a specified server on the local network, allowing internet users to access services on the server in the local network by accessing that port. 
</p>
<p class="text">
By opening and mapping ports, port forwarding enables accessibility of internal network resources from external networks, providing a convenient and secure way for remote users to connect to and use computers or services in the internal network.
