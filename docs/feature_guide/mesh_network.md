<p class="text">
Mesh networks are widely used in many application scenarios, such as smart homes, Internet of Things, urban coverage, industrial automation, etc. It provides a resilient, reliable and flexible network solution suitable for environments that require a high degree of interconnectivity and self-organization.
</p>
<p class="text">
Generally speaking, a Mesh router device supports up to 7 (including existing device mesh devices). So if you need to add more mesh devices to create a more powerful network in your home, you can simply pair your new mesh devices with your existing network.
</p>

### __Add Mesh Extender__
<p class="text">
Pairing on the Web :
</p>
<p class="text">
1 . Log in to "Your IP Address".
</p>
<p class="text">
2 . More Settings ➡ Mesh Network ➡ Mesh Table
</p>
<p class="text">
3 . Click on “Add” and then follow the prompts on the screen.
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="boxshadow" src="/images/mesh01.png">
</div>
- Before adding a device,please confirm that the main router has successfully connected to the Internet.

- Place the Mesh Node to be added near the main router. If the Mesh Node has been used, please reset it.

- Power on the Mesh node, and after it has started up, press the pair button.
<p class="text">
4 . After ensuring that the mesh nodes are placed appropriately and the network is connected, click Next on this page.
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>
<p class="text">
6 . Waiting for scan results.
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="boxshadow" src="/images/mesh04.png">
</div>
<p class="text">
7 . If no available node routes are scanned, check the following points:
</p>
- Check whether the Mesh node presses the pairing button. After pressing the pairing button, the indicator light of the Mesh node will flash blue slowly.
- Check whether the Mesh node has been used. If it has been used, please reset it.
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="boxshadow" src="/images/mesh06.png">
</div>

<p class="text">
8 . If the scan is successful, device information will appear. Select the scanned device to add it.
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="boxshadow" src="/images/mesh07.png">
</div>
<p class="text">
9 . Click Refresh after prompting that the addition is successful and wait for about two minutes.
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="boxshadow" src="/images/mesh08.png">
</div>
<p class="text">
10 . After refreshing, you can view the information of the new device on the add page.You can modify the device name on this page so that you can better identify it.

## __Advanced__
### __Roaming__
<p class="text">
Wireless roaming technology allows your devices to seamlessly switch between two mesh routers. When you move away from one router and closer to another, it will automatically disconnect the current connection and connect to the closer router for a smoother network user experience. No manual intervention is required during the switch and it will not affect the network connection.
</p>

### __Roaming Threshold__
<p class="text">
The wireless roaming trigger threshold should only be set by experienced professionals. If you lack professional experience in setting the roaming trigger threshold, it is recommended that you keep the default settings to avoid negative impacts on the network user experience.

### __Topology Optimization__
<p class="text">
When your paired devices are greater than or equal to 3 devices, after all devices are paired, optimization can be turned on. 
</p>
<p class="text">
This function can automatically adjust the optimal path according to the signal strength between the devices, so as to ensure that all sub-routes and corresponding upper-level devices have the best signal connection status for optimal network coverage.
</p>
### __Threshold of Topology Optimization__
<p class="text">
You can adjust the signal threshold triggered by topology optimization to obtain the best mesh network coverage. If you do not have professional experience in setting this, we recommend that you set it according to the default value.
