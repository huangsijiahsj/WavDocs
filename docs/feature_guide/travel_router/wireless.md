### __Enable dual-band integration__

2.4G and 5G wireless networks use the same wireless name. When the terminal connects to Wi-Fi, the router will automatically select the Internet frequency band for the terminal according to the network conditions. Set the wireless name and wireless password, select an encryption method, and click __"Save"__.

__SSID__ : Maximum length is no more than 31 characters, and Chinese characters are no more than 10 characters.

__Encryption method__ : The wireless encryption of this router uses WPA2-PSK encryption method and AES encryption algorithm by default. The wireless password is 8 to 63 characters, preferably a combination of numbers, letters, and symbols.

Switching the encryption protocol from WPA2 to WPA3 can enhance the encryption algorithm and improve the connection security of Wi-Fi devices.

### __Turn off dual-band__

Turn off dual-band integration to set up 2.4G and 5G networks separately. Click the button on the right to turn off dual-band integration.
