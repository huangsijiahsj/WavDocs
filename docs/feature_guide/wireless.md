<p class="text">
Turning on the dual-band switch combines the 2.4G and 5G Wi-Fi bands into one to provide a better network experience, while turning off the dual-band integration allows you to set up the 2.4G and 5G networks separately.

### __Encryption Method__
<p class="text">
 Considering security and compatibility, it is currently recommended to use WPA2-PSK or WPA3-PSK/WPA2-MIX encryption.

The following are several common Wi-Fi encryption methods and their functions :
</p>
___
###__Wi-Fi encryption methods__
> WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy)

> - Function 
Provide basic security protection, encrypt data, and prevent unauthorized users from accessing the network.
> - Disadvantages : 
Poor security and vulnerable to cracking attacks.

>WPA/WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access)

> - Function : Provide stronger security protection, use pre-shared key (PSK) or enterprise-level authentication method to encrypt data.

>WPA2 

>- It is an upgraded version of WPA, using a more secure encryption algorithm (such as AES) to provide higher security.


>WPA3

>- Function : It is the latest upgraded version of WPA/WPA2, providing stronger security and protection mechanism.
>- Improvement : Introduced more secure encryption protocols (such as Simultaneous Authentication of Equals, SAE) and password cracking protection.


> *Considering security and compatibility, it is currently recommended to use WPA2 or WPA3 encryption.If your device supports WPA3, then choosing WPA3 will provide higher security. For older devices that may not support WPA3, WPA2 is still a better choice. It is important that no matter which encryption method is used, strong passwords should be set and changed regularly to ensure network security.*

## __Advanced__
### __Chanel__
<p class="text">
 You can manually change the channel corresponding to the corresponding wireless network. If you don't know how to select the channel, we recommend that you select Auto, the device will select the best channel according to the surrounding environment to get a better network experience.

### __Bandwidth__
<p class="text">
 The bandwidth of the frequency band that the router transmits wireless data.
</p>
### __Hide SSID__
<p class="text">
When enabled, the wireless signal of the corresponding network will be hidden.
</p>
### __DFS__
<p class="text">
Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) - it is recommended to turn on this switch so that the device will automatically avoid channel values that are not allowed in your area.
</p>
### __TWT__
<p class="text">
When enabled, the router will automatically optimize resource scheduling between devices, negotiate wake-up times, reduce disorderly competition, increase device sleep time, and improve router lifespan.
</p>
### __MU-OFDMA__
<p class="text">
After activation, the router will multiplex multiple users to improve transmission efficiency and reduce network latency in a multi-user Internet environment.
